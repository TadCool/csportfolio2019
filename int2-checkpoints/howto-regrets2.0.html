    <h1 class="center" width="50%">Some of my Regrets</h1>
    <p style="width: 50%" class="center">One thing I regret from this project is 
    not adding enough to my art page. If I used my time better I could have done better 
    on my art page and added more complicated coding. Another thing I regret is not 
    using my time wisely enough. I could have worked longer if I weren't distracted 
    by my table mates and if I didn't distract others too. During future projects 
    I will try to use my time better and not procrastinate or spend time focusing 
    on unrelated work. <br>
    <br>
    Although something positive that my tablemates brought was a periodical mind 
    break. Every once and a while my table mates would start talking and this gave 
    me a mental break from working and I was able to keep my work pace because of 
    this.
