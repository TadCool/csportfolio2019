    <h1 class="center" width="50%">My Art Page</h1>
    <p style="width: 50%" class="center">I created this page because Iâ€™m very 
    close to my mom and she loves philosophy and something that she talks about 
    a lot is how life is always fading. We believe in the idea of reincarnation 
    so while creating my code I was thinking about doing something like that. 
    Whenever you click, you get a second chance to see the colors again before it 
    quickly gets consumed by the black lines covering the screen. I also gave the 
    user a choice on what color they want to see, this is why depending on where 
    you click the background changes color. I asked my mom on some ideas of what 
    to do for my art page and she began to talk about the meaning of life and 
    stuff like that. I believe that my art piece, while simple, accomplished my 
    goal. I also used some code from previous projects to add to the symbolism 
    and to keep a theme going in my project (keep the same colors throughout the 
    project). The circles that track your mouse also represent the people in your 
    life that eventually fade away over time.
