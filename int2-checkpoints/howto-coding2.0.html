    <h1 class="center" width="50%">Starting the Code</h1>
    <p style="width: 50%" class="center">The first thing you need to learn is how to
    first start your code. Before starting out each page you copy and paste a template
    into a blank JS page. Then you need to link the JS page into a seperate html page,
    this way you can see what you are coding.

<div id="img2">
    <h1 class="center" width="50%">Linking HTML</h1>
    <p style="width: 50%" class="center">After you have copy and pasted the
    template into the JS file, you then have to link the JS file into an HTML 
    file. In this case, my JS file is titled "test" so I would insert "test.js"
    into my HTMl page.

<div id="img3">
    <h1 class="center" width="50%">Shapes</h1>
    <p style="width: 50%" class="center">One of the basics in JS is to find out
    how to create shapes. The two main shapes that you will be using are rectangles
    and ellipses (circles and other round shapes). <br>
    <br>
    In order to create a rectangle you need to start by using a "rect" function.
    You create a rect function by setting the coordinates and size of the object. 
    </p>
<img src="images/jscode5.jpg" width="50%" class="center"/>
<img src="images/jscode6.jpg" width="50%" class="center"/>
<p style="width: 50%" class="center">The concept is the same with the ellipse, 
the only difference is that this object will be round instead of square.
</p>
<img src="images/jscode7.jpg" width="50%" class="center"/>
<img src="images/jscode8.jpg" width="50%" class="center"/>

<p style="width: 50%" class="center">Something to remember is that with the rectangle,
the coordinates set the start of the top left corner, while with ellipses, the
coordinate determines the center.<br>
<br>
The JS code reads the text from top down, so based on the code, the ellipse is layered
over the rectanlge, but if you swap them then the rectangle will overlap the circle.

<div id="img4">
    <h1 class="center" width="50%">Color</h1>
    <p style="width: 50%" class="center">In order to add color into the shapes, 
    you must use the fill code. This code is read from top to bottom, this means
    that you have to add the fill code above the shape you want to color. The code 
    uses RGB ratios to code, this means that if you want the color to be white you
    use fill(255,255,255); but if you want it to be black you would used fill(0,0,0);.
    </p>
<img src="images/jscode11.jpg" width="50%" class="center"/>
<img src="images/jscode12.jpg" width="50%" class="center"/>

<p style="width: 50%" class="center">
    In order to code the background color you would need to use the code 
    background(0,0,0); or whatever combination of rgb you need to make the 
    color you want. In this case its dark yellow:

</div>

<div id="img5">
    <h1 class="center" width="50%">Animation</h1>
    
    <p style="width: 50%" class="center">Before you create an animation you need 
    to create a variable that tells the code where to move. This can be done by 
    using the var fucntion. By using a variable instead of a number, you isert 
    the keyword for the variable into multiple functions in order to change all 
    of the numbers at once instead of individually.
    </p>
    
    <img src="images/jscode15.jpg" width="50%" class="center"/>
    <img src="images/jscode16.jpg" width="50%" class="center"/>
    <img src="images/jscode17.jpg" width="50%" class="center"/>
    <img src="images/jscode18.jpg" width="50%" class="center"/>
    
    <p style="width: 50%" class="center">Animation works a lot of different ways,
    in this case I will use a draw function. This is a function that repeatedly 
    creates shapes that you put into the draw function. The way you do this is by 
    copying and pasting the shapes into the draw function but not the variable 
    function. Next thing you do is add the animation part to the function. This 
    is hard to explain but I'll try. What you need to do is use the variable, in 
    this case its "size" and make it equal to itself "size = size" but then add 
    a number to make it animate "size = size + 1". 
    </p>

    <img src="images/jscode21.jpg" width="50%" class="center"/>
    <img src="images/jscode22.jpg" width="50%" class="center"/>
    
    <p style="width: 50%" class="center">In this case it grows by increments of 1. 
    By changing the + 1 to a higher number, you can vary the speed at which the 
    shape(s) grows.

<div id="img6">
    <h1 class="center" width="50%">My Art Page</h1>
    <p style="width: 50%" class="center"> My art page has lines that are continuously 
    animating in the background, and when you move the mouse a circle with a pattern 
    on it follows the mouse.
    </p>
    
<img src="images/jscode23.jpg" width="50%" class="center"/>

    <p style="width: 50%" class="center">This works by using the draw function. 
    I inserted 4 different functions, each function produces 3 lines that spawn from 
    the corners of the page to random spots. I labeled these functions as "lineFunction1-4" 
    then I created an ellipse function and added that into the draw function as well. 
    This means that lines are continuously being created in the background, this 
    creats an artificial background. While there is an actually backgound it gets 
    covered up by the lines: blackening it. As you can see there are also circles 
    that show up wherever the mouse is. This is accomplished through an ellipse 
    function using the mouse coordinates. However, I also have to insert the ellipse 
    into the draw function. If I didn't insert the ellipse into the function there 
    would only be one static ellipse that follows your mouse, but if you put into 
    the draw function, then there will be a trail of circles that follow your mouse 
    and this is what I wanted in my art page.
    </p>
    
<img src="images/jscode24.jpg" width="50%" class="center"/>
<img src="images/jscode25.jpg" width="50%" class="center"/>


 <p style="width: 50%" class="center">MouseX is equivilant to where the mouse is 
 on the x-axis, and MouseY is where the mouse is on the y-axis. 
 <br>
 <br>
 Something that you may notice is that there is a "for" function. This is what you
  call a "for loop". This is what creates the pattern on my circle, a and b are 
  variables for the size of my circle. I created a loop that continuously changes 
  the size of the circle. First a vertically elongated circle with a width of 15 
  and height of 30, and another with the width of 30 and height of 15 as well as two
  circles, one with a height and width of 30 and another with 15. This creates all 
  these circles at once which creates an interesting pattern on my circle that 
  matches well with the background and adds complexity to the piece.
 </p>
    
    <img src="images/jscode26.jpg" width="50%" class="center"/>
    
    <p style="width: 50%" class="center">Another thing that I added into my code 
    is that when you click on the corners of the screen the loop restarts and the 
    background changes color. Top left is red, top right is green, bottom left is blue, 
    and the bottom right is yellow. I added this because the art piece was lacking 
    color and was very black and white. I wanted to add more 'life' to the piece 
    and adding color was the best way to do this.
    
    </p>
    
    <img src="images/jscode27.jpg" width="50%" class="center"/>
    
    <p style="width: 50%" class="center">In this section of code, 
    if the mouse is on the left side of the screen and on the top half (or the 
    top left corner) then when you click the background will turn red. This uses an 
    "if" statement, using the top/bottom half and left/right half of the screen to 
    determine what quadrant your mouse is on. The "if" statements also change the 
    color of the circles from white to the color of the background by using a fill 
    function. Because this is in a mouseClicked function, whenever you clicked 
    then the if functions would kick in. This added a user interaction into the 
    piece and increased the complexity while also doubling as a reset to the art 
    page.

<div id="img8">
    <h1 class="center" width="50%">Choices</h1>
    
    <p style="width: 50%" class="center">Some of the choices I made were what colors 
    I should use for my project. Originally I wanted to make the lines white, 
    but I didn't know how to, so instead I left it black. The next choice I had to 
    make was what colors I should use for the corners. I decided to use the windows 
    logo colors for my art page. This is because the windows logo was fitting for 
    an art page on the computer since Windows only had 4 colors in the logo and 
    it added an 'inside joke' for those who noticed the logo.
