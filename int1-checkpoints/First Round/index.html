        <h2>Personal Biography</h2>

        <p style="display:inline-block; width: 700px">My name is Nicholas Rusali, I was born on December 27 2003. I was born one day before my dad's birthday (Decemeber 28) which was a fun coincidence. Everyone in my family is born in the year of December except for my sister. She was born
            on March 25 and in terms of birthday's, she is the black sheep of the family. My favorite subjects in school are Math and Science. This is because I think that it's fun to solve problem in Math class and Science are fun because I
            get to do experiments and test out different hypothesis's. I have an older brother and as previously mentioned, a younger sister. I have a mom and a dad who take care of us at home and I currently have 5 dogs. My dog is Mochi who
            is a teacup multese so he is very small. My brother is 17 years old and currently goes to Carnegie Mellon University located in Pittsburgh, PA and my sister goes to Ingrid B. Lacie Middle School in Pacifica. My mom is a college leadership
            teacher and my dad works from home at AT&T.
