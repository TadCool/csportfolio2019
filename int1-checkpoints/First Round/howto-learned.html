    <h1 class="center" width="50%">What I Learned</h1>
    <p style="width: 50%" class="center">I learned many things with the About Me project. This project really helped
         strengthen my confidence in myself with using html and css. I also learned how to create many things with css
         and html that I wouldn't have learned unless I worked on the project. The one major thing that increased my 
         connection and familiarity with the code was the navagation. The navagation was the <i>hardest</i> thing I 
         have ever done. I didn't understand anything about how to make a navbar or how to use css very well (other 
         than what I learned from Khan Academy) but the navbar really forced me to learn these things and learn how 
         html interacts with css. This project helped me understand how to use css efficiently and not just <i>because
         I can</i>.
