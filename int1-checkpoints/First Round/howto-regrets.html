    <h1 class="center" width="50%">Some of my Regrets</h1>
    <p style="width: 50%" class="center">If I had more time to work on my About Me page I would have 
    probably worked on organizing it better. What I mean by that is, make sure the colors are what I 
    want them to be, make sure that all of the images fit properly and are properly located. Some other
    things I regret with my page is that I feel I didn't put enough information into it. If I were to 
    have more time, I would probably try to insert more information into the text.<br>
    <br>
    If I were to do the project again, now that I know more about html I can try to learn new things 
    that I couldn't do with my time limit. Also, now that I more about css I can try to work harder to 
    do more complicated designs. An example of this is instead of just inserting images, I can 
    try inserting video's into the page.
