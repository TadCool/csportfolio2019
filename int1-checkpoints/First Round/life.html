  <p style="display:inline-block; width: 700px"> Many of the hobbies that I have I do in my personal life, so in order to keep this part of the page original 
  I will try to write something that is new. I currently have a job at the fast food chain McDonald's. I first  started this job 
  in the January of this year so I have been woring there for a couple months now. They  hire at the age of 14 and my 
  parents thought it would be a good idea for me to get a job. They said it  was because I was spending too much time on 
  video games and they wanted me to do something with  my life and something for my college application. Before they told me to get 
  a job, they wanted me to join an afterschool club (not from school). My sister and cousin were part of Dragon Boating so I tried 
  to do that, but in the end it wasn't for me. After that a friend told me about how he has a job at McDonald's and how I should
  join him. I ended up applying but I didn't get the job at first. It took me two times to apply before I finally got the job and now 
  I work around 3 shifts a week, two on weekends, one one weekdays. </p>
