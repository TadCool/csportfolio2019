     <h2>What I do on my Free Time</h2>
     
  <p style="display:inline-block; width: 700px">On my Free Time I like to play guitar. 
  I have been playing guitar for about 3 years now and I find it really fun.
  Most of the time though, I play video games. My favorite video game is League of 
  Legends. I play this daily  and my parents say I'm addicted. Another game I play is 
  Rainbow Six Siege, a FPS game that has "operators"  who are classes by their speed 
  and armor as well as whether they are on attack or defence. I spend most of my  
  time playing League of Legends with friends from school and online. This game is 
  known for making people angry because of how the game works, but I still think 
  it's pretty fun. Rainbow Six Siege is a more of a casual  game where you 
  can fool around in games without getting punished by the other players.
