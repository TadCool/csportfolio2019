    <h1 class="center" width="50%">Starting the Code</h1>
    <p style="width: 50%" class="center">The first step to making anything in html is to start with the DOCTYPE. 
    The DOCTYPE is special meaning it's different from the rest of the code. Before you start working on your code,
    you need to specify what language you are using so the browser can understand what the code means. The DOCTYPE 
    is not a tag, it's more of a dictionary for the browser to understand the language of the code and properly 
    transfer it onto the page. In order to insert the DOCTYPE all you need to do is type "!" into the first line 
    and hit tab in html. This automatically gives you a template to work with as well as specifying the doc type.

    <p style="width: 50%" class="center">In this How To page, I will be explaining how 
    to create an about me page.
    The first step to creating an About Me page is the first map out what you want it 
    to look like. Grab a notebook
    and sketch out what you want the page to look like. <strong>Do you want a navigation bar? 
    Do you want a colored background? </strong>
    Ask yourself these kinds of questions and find out how you want it to look like. 
    Once you finsihed this then you 
    can start coding.

    <h1 class="center" width="50%">Inserting Headers</h1>
    <p style="width: 50%" class="center">Next is to actually work on the pages for your site. 
    The first thing you need to do is give a title to the page, and in order to do that you have
    to insert a header. The way you do this is with the header tag. This tag looks like this: "< h1 >< /h1>"
    Between the starting tag and ending tag you can write whatever you want the title to be. There 
    are also different different headers, you can go between them by changing the number next to h (ie. 
    "< h2 >").

    <h1 class="center" width="50%">Making Paragraphs</h1>
    <p style="width: 50%" class="center">Making paragraphs is one of the basics of coding and is your "bread and butter"
    of the code. Most of your writing will probably be using hte paragraph tags. The paragraph tag will allow you to
    type large bodies of words into your page.

    <h1 class="center" width="50%">Making Lists</h1>
    <p style="width: 50%" class="center">
        Lists are something I didn't use very often but nevertheless, are still important 
        and part of the basics of coding. Now first thing you need to know about lists is that
        there are two different types of lists: the unordered list (labled as "ul") and ordered
        list (labeled as "ol"). The unordered list will have bullet points for the list items,
        and the ordered list will have numbers instead. The list needs an openning tag and a closing
        tag. The openning tag looks like this "< ol >" for the ordered list and "< ul >" for the 
        unordered list. The closing tag looks identical to those, but just with a backslash in front 
        of the letters: "< /ol >" or "< /ul >". However just writing these tags and putting words in 
        them will not make them a list. In order to tell the code that you want to make it a list then
        you have to specify that the words you are typing are "list items". In order to do this you 
        make an openning and closing tag for list items: "< li >" and "< /li >". Here is a real-life 
        example of this: 
    </p>

<div id="img6">
    <h1 class="center" width="50%">The Navbar</h1>
    <p style="width: 50%" class="center"> For my About Me page I decided to use a 
    navigation bar. So I started out with that first.
    </p>
<img src="images/code3.jpg" width="50%" class="center"/>
    <p style="width: 50%" class="center">This is the code for the navagation bar. The 
    "< a href="">< /a > tag is the tag that is used to insert a link. Whatever words 
    insert in between will show up on the navbar and when clicked, will send you to 
    the whatever link you used. For example, if you write www.youtube.com between the 
    quotes in the "href" then the link will be inserted into the page. However, 
    if you want to have a word that is linked, what you need to do is write the 
    word with the link in between the anchor tags or the "< a >< /a >". Then you would 
    put that in a list and use css to change the way it looks. 
    A real-life example of this in my About Me page is with my navbar:
    </p>
<img src="images/navbarexp2.jpg" width="50%" class="center"/>
<img src="images/navbarexp3.jpg" width="50%" class="center"/>
<img src="images/navbarexp4.jpg" width="50%" class="center"/>
 <p style="width: 50%" class="center">As you can see with the code, whatever words I write in 
 between the anchor tags will show on the page with the links embedded into them.
 However, in order to show the whole code I didn't place the links into the href's, 
 but for my navigation bar I had to copy&paste the links of the pages I want into the href's.
 I also used css to style the navbar, the way I did this is by making a seperate page of css coding and
 linking it into the the html page.

<div id="img7">
    <h1 class="center" width="50%">Styling with CSS</h1>
    <p style="width: 50%" class="center">For me, css was very complicated, not only because it is but 
    also because it's a whole other language. I can't explain everything I did here, but I can try to 
    explain the basics and concepts of css. <br> <br>
    The first thing you need to understand about css is that it's only used for styling, meaning that 
    you still need to know html in order to use css. Also in order for html to recognize taht you are 
    using css, you need to tell it that you are using a different language. There are 3 ways to style 
    with css, there is external, internal, and inline. <br> <br>
    
    Each changes in specificity, the most specific 
    is inline. This is where you go into a tag and put a style attribute into the tag in order to style 
    that one piece of code (the <strong>style=""</strong> is refered to as an attribute). Inline styling 
    especially good when you only want to style one tag and don't need to go through the work of making a 
    seperate css page, or a style tag. 
    </p>
<img src="images/css.jpg" width="50%" class="center"/>
<img src="images/css2.jpg" width="50%" class="center"/>

 <p style="width: 50%" class="center">The other way to do this is the internal styling where you would
     write a style tag into the head of the html code and then type css, nesting in the style tags (nesting means
     to insert something in between an openning and closing tag). The 
     style tag tells the html code that you are going to css in there. 

</p>
<img src="images/exp3.jpg" width="50%" class="center"/>
<img src="images/exp4.jpg" width="50%" class="center"/>

<p style="width: 50%" class="center">The difference between inline and the internal is that is in internal
     is that you need to specify what tag you are trying to style. As you can see in the image you need to 
     specify the tag you are trying to style, you do this by just typing what the tag is (without the less 
     "<" or ">"). Next, you need to add a curly open and closing bracket, between these brackets you need 
     to write what you are trying to change (in this case the color) and what you want to change it into 
     (in this case its blue). This type of styling is good when you are trying to style a lot on a single 
     page and don't want to go in one-by-one trying to style every tag. 

</p>
<p style="width: 50%" class="center">The last and most complicated but the most useful is the external
     styling. Here you create a seperate css page, then link that page into the head of the html page you
     want to style using a link tag. For my about me page I made a seperate css page and called it 
     "aboutme.css" and inserted links into each of the 4 pages. This way I don't have to retype the same
     styling for every page, instead I can just insert the link into each page (through copy & paste) and 
     all of the pages will have the same styling. This is useful because it saves a lot of time and can
     help when you are trying to style multiple pages at once.

<img src="images/css4.jpg" width="60%" class="center"/>
<img src="images/css5.jpg" width="80%" class="center"/>

<p style="width: 50%" class="center">In the link, all you need to do is write the name of the page into the 
     href. Once you have done this and inserted the link into all the pages you want, then you can go into 
     css page and style whatever you want and it'll transfer onto the pages with the links. Here is an example
     of this from my about me page:

<div id="img8">
    <h1 class="center" width="50%">Choices</h1>
    <p style="width: 50%" class="center">The majority of the choices I made for my About Me project was 
     with the css portion of my page. I had to decide what background I should use, along with what color 
     scheme I should use and what to write as my information for the page. The way I went about deciding 
     these things were to ask my table mates. Cooperation is key to learning more, without the help of 
     others I probably wouldn't be able to even write this paragraph, but thanks to the people around me
     I was able to learn more and also have the opportunity to help teach others. <br> <br>
     Another decision I had to make was which website I used to help me. There are many websites that can
     help you on your coding journey but the ones that I used were:<br>
     <br>
     1. W3Schools<br>
     2. HTMLEntities<br>
     3. Cloud 9 (The coding site I used)
