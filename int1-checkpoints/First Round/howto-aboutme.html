    <h1 class="center" width="50%">My About Me project</h1>
    <p style="width: 50%" class="center">My name is Nicholas Rusali and I'm a student at Summit Shasta High
    School. A project that I had to do in coding class was the About Me page.
    This was a page that was a test for the teacher to get an understanding of my skill level. In this page 
    I had to use almost everything I learned and implement them in some way into the project. I made a 
    navagation bar and the standard header, paragraph and lists. I created 4 different pages that were all 
    linked together using the navagation bar. Overall the project works by using different pages and linking 
    them together using anchor tags in a list. All of the complicated stuff with the visuals was done in css.
    I did this by making a seperate css page and linking it into the 4 html pages so they all matched with each 
    other. In each page, it starts with header, after that in the html I inserted a "div" bellow that (this was so I could 
    style the div sepereatly from the header in css). In the div I had a paragraph and image nested into it.
    In css I put a border around the div and gave an id to the image so that it can have its own border as well. 
    So there was a border around the image and the paragraph/image. Here is an image of what I'm talking about:
