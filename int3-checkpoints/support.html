    <h1>Supports</h1>
    <p>There are two types of supports, those who are offensive and those who are defensive. The offensive supports help 
    assist your marksmen to get kills and help your team engage in fights/get picks before the fight starts. The defensive supports 
    have the job of keeping the marksmen alive during laning phase (during the early phases of the game) or to protect them 
    during team fights.</p>

    <!--Description of the class type-->
    <p>Catchers are the offensive types of supports, their job is to stun or relocate the enemy so that they are easier to kill for 
    your team/marksmen. These types of supports are usually melee and are closest resembling the fighter class.</p>

    <h2>Enchanters:</h2>

    </ul>
    <p>These type of supports are the ones that try to keep your marksmen alive during team fights and throughout the rest 
    of the game. Because of their role, they mostly focus on shielding and healing the team. This role is safer than the 
    catcher supports since they are not always in the middle of the fight but instead are on the sidelines. However, in some games 
    they do get focused and get targetted by assassins. This is because you can't kill the marksmen unless you kill the support. This 
    goes for both catchers and enchanters.</p>
