        How To Page
    </h1>
    <h2>
        What did I create?
    </h2>
    <p>
        I created an art page that creates lines that loops in order to cover the screen. This art page also creates ellipses that follow wherever the mouse goes. Another thing that happens is when you click on either the top right/left or bottom right/left the
        color of the background changes.
    </p>

    <h2>
        How does the project work overall?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Well with the combonation of line functions and ellipses functions, I was able to create a pattern for my art page. By making an if statement and a mouseclicked statement I was able to change the background based on where you clicked. This reset the loop
        and also changed the color of the ellipses that follow your mouse.

    <h2>
        What are some specifics of the code and how to they work?
    </h2>
    <p>
        The random code makes different numbers random. If I used a fixed number to spawn the lines, the lines will always
        spawn in the same spot, I didn't like the way this looked so I chose to make it random. This way every time I 
        reloaded the page it creates a new pattern.

        What choices did you make and how did you go about making them?
